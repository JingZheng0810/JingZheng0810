## Purpose

This report is about analyzing the NYPD Shooting Incident Data (Historic). The specific dataset can be found here:  https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/nypd-shooting-incident-data-historic. I will focus on exploring two parts:

1. Which area of New York has the most number of incidents?

2. Which groups account for the most perpetrator and victims, respectively?

## Step 0: Import Library

First of all, we need to install some packages for the following analysis.

```{r library, message = FALSE}
# install.packages("tidyverse")
# install.packages("lubridate")
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
```

## Step 1: Import Data

Now I will start by reading in the data from the csv file.

```{r get_NYPD Shooting Incidengt_data}
# Get current Data in the files.
urls <- "https://data.cityofnewyork.us/api/views/833y-fsy8/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD"
NYPD_data <- read_csv(urls)
# Take a quick look at the variables in the NYPD_data.
head(NYPD_data)
```

## Step 2: Tidy and Transform Data

After looking at NYPD_data, I would like to tidy those data. First, I will not use PRECINCT, JURISDICTION_CODE, LOCATION_DESC, X_COORD_CD, Y_COORD_CD, and Lon_Lat for the analysis I am planning, so I will get rid of those columns.

```{r tidy_NYPD_data}
NYPD_data <- NYPD_data %>%
  select(INCIDENT_KEY,
         OCCUR_DATE,
         OCCUR_TIME,
         BORO,
         STATISTICAL_MURDER_FLAG,
         PERP_AGE_GROUP,
         PERP_SEX,
         PERP_RACE,
         VIC_AGE_GROUP,
         VIC_SEX,
         VIC_RACE,
         Latitude,
         Longitude)
# return summary of the data
summary(NYPD_data)
```

## Step 3: Data Analysis

### Question 1：

Count the occurrences of incidents in each borough to see which area of New York has the most number of incidents.

```{r}
# aggregate borough data
boro_data <- as.data.frame(table(NYPD_data["BORO"]))
# sort borough data by descending frequency
boro_data[order(-boro_data$Freq),]

# We also make a plot of borough data
ggplot(NYPD_data, aes(x=BORO)) + 
  geom_bar() + 
  labs(title = "Boroughs of New York City",
       x = "Boroughs of New York City",
       y = "Count of Incidents") +
  theme_minimal()
```

We can see that there have most incidents in Brooklyn, followed by Bronx and Queens, while Staten Island has the least.

### Question 2：

Count the age, sex, and race of both perpetrator and victims to see which groups account for the most perpetrator and victims.

First I will count the PERP_AGE_GROUP and VIC_AGE_GROUP.

```{r}
# First count two age datasets
PERP_age_data <- NYPD_data %>%
group_by(PERP_AGE_GROUP) %>%
count()
PERP_age_data

VIC_age_data <- NYPD_data %>%
group_by(VIC_AGE_GROUP) %>%
count()
VIC_age_data
```

As we see, PERP_AGE_GROUP has four more categories than VIC_AGE_GROUP which are "1020", "224", "940" and "NA". This may be caused by input errors or other reasons. In order to facilitate us and combine two sets of data, we classify these four categories as "UNKNOWN". Then I will concatenate two results to display them in a bar chart.

```{r}
# isolate perpetrator age group
PERP_age_data_1 <- NYPD_data["PERP_AGE_GROUP"]
# replace <NA>, 1020, 224 and 940 by UNKNOWN
PERP_age_data_1[is.na(PERP_age_data_1)] <- "UNKNOWN"
PERP_age_data_1$PERP_AGE_GROUP[PERP_age_data_1$PERP_AGE_GROUP == "1020"] <- "UNKNOWN"
PERP_age_data_1$PERP_AGE_GROUP[PERP_age_data_1$PERP_AGE_GROUP == "224"] <- "UNKNOWN"
PERP_age_data_1$PERP_AGE_GROUP[PERP_age_data_1$PERP_AGE_GROUP == "940"] <- "UNKNOWN" 

# aggregate perpetrator age group
PERP_age_data_final <- table(PERP_age_data_1)
# aggregate victim age group
VIC_age_data <- table(NYPD_data["VIC_AGE_GROUP"])
# concatenate perpetrator and victim
age_data <- rbind(PERP_age_data_final, VIC_age_data)
# display as a bar chart
barplot(age_data, beside = TRUE)

```

Then we count the PERP_SEX and VIC_SEX.

```{r}
# aggregate perpetrator sex data
PERP_sex_data <- table(NYPD_data["PERP_SEX"])
# aggregate victim sex data
VIC_sex_data <- table(NYPD_data["VIC_SEX"])
# concatenate both perpetrator and victim
sex_data <- rbind(PERP_sex_data, VIC_sex_data)
# display as a bar chart
barplot(sex_data, beside = TRUE)
```

Finally, we count the PERP_RACE and VIC_RACE.

```{r}
# aggregate the perpetrator race data
PERP_race_data <- table(NYPD_data["PERP_RACE"])
# aggregate the victim race data
VIC_race_data <- table(NYPD_data["VIC_RACE"])
# concatenate perpetrator and victim
race_data <- rbind(PERP_race_data, VIC_race_data)
# rename columns to shorter version
colnames(race_data) <- c('American/Alaskan','Asian/Pacific','Black', 'Black Hisp', 'Unknown', 'White', 'White Hisp')
# display as a bar chart
barplot(race_data, beside = TRUE, las=2, cex.names=.75)
```

We can summarize the following three points from graphs. Firstly, the age group of 18-22 and 25-44 accounts for a large number of both perpetrators and victims.
Secondly, there are more incidents with males than females in both perpetrator and victim groups. Thirdly, Black is significantly most represented category for both perpetrator and victim groups.

## Step 4: Identify Bias

In this report, since the initial data set is a record of reported incidents, the first bias is that not all incidents are reported. This dataset is collected by NYPD officers and NYC officials who may be biased in the collection, labeling, and reporting of this data. Another bias is from which I re-categorize <NA> as UNKNOWN.

## Conclusion

To conclude, I have answered both my questions from the analysis done above. The answers are as follows:

1. There have most incidents in Brooklyn, followed by Bronx and Queens, while Staten Island has the least.
2. The age group of 18-22 and 25-44 accounts for a large number of both perpetrators and victims. There are more incidents with males than females in both perpetrator and victim groups. And Black is significantly most represented category for both perpetrator and victim groups.
